/**
 * Advance the sequence number when we have processed all available mergable events. Be warned if there are consumers
 * behind the merging batch processor then this has a risk of starvation. In this case the merging batch processor will
 * perpetually consume new events to be merged.
 * 
 * Avoid using this if the producer this likely to producer faster than the consumer and reproduce a previously merged
 * key within the period it takes to process the merged event.
 * 
 * In cases where the merging batch processor is the last consumer in the pipe line this setting is safe.
 * 
 * It is technically more correct to merge in this mode and allows the merging batch process to mutate the merged event.
